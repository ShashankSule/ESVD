This is the code repository for the paper "On the limits of neural network explainability via descrambling" by Sule, Czaja, Spencer. To reproduce our figures, first download the `workspace_23_11.mat` file from [here](https://umd.box.com/s/zul3iaq9x6u332nydsc6lo19uvote8ry). You will need MATLAB >= 2022a with the DeepLearning and Symbolic Computation toolboxes downloaded. Our experiments concern the network `DEERNet` [^1]. A 2-layer version of this network was proposed for the purposes of illustrating NN descrambling[^3]. We will work with this two layer DEERNet. 

1. The mat file `workspace_23_11.mat` contains a DEERNet trained according to the specifications in Amey et. al 2021 [^2]. To regenerate the figures and work with our data, you may simply run the files `figs1_2.m` for Figures 1 & 2, `figs3.m` for Figure 3, and `figs4.m` for Figure 4. Here the file `descramble.m` implements the projected gradient descent via the Cayley transform on the orthogonal group and was first written in an older version of the Spinach package. See [here](https://spindynamics.org/wiki/index.php?title=Descramble.m). The visualizations with the Chebyshev fitting use an implementation of the Chebyshev polynomials due to John Burkardt [^4]. 

2. If you want to retrain a new DEERNet altogether, you will need the [DEERNet](https://github.com/IlyaKuprov/DEERNet) repository published by [Prof. Ilya Kuprov](spindynamics.org). After downloading the DEERNet repository in the current folder, change lines 30-48 in `DEERNet/kernel/dist_net.m` to reflect the two-layer DEERNet architecture used for descrambling[^1]. Next, run the file `train_DEERNet.m`. Make sure you have enough disk space!
